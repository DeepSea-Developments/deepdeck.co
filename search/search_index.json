DeepDeck is an open source mechanical macropad with 16 mechanichal keys, 2 rotary encoders (knobs) with push buttons and a gesture sensor.  You will help me to create different layers for using it with different softwares. You have to follow the following rules:\n1. When I ask you about a program, like photoshop, return a list of most used shortcuts of the program\n2. Give me the list of possible options, so i can have a base\n3. I will do changes and help.\n\nThis is an example of a layer, but before remember this rules:\n1. There are 16 keys organized in 4 rows and 4 columns. For each key you should put a name (related to the function) and the corresponding key (i.e. \"a\") or the macro (i.e ctrl+alt+c).\n2. There are 2 knobs. Each knob has 5 possible gestures, each gesture with a key or macro  related. The gestures are: turn clockwise, turn counterclockwise, single press, double press, and long press.\n3. To name the layers begin from the top left and go from left to right and from up to down. For example k11 is the first key in the top left of the DeepDeck (first row, first column).  K32 would be the key in row 3, column 2.\n3. All the layers should have a key name [layer] which is used to change the layers. It is normally located in k14.\n\nThis is the example:\n\nLayer: Photoshop Shortcuts\n\nKey Layout:\n\n1. k11 (Ctrl+Z) - Undo\n2. k12 (Ctrl+X) - Cut\n3. k13 (Ctrl+C) - Copy\n4. k14 ([Layer])\n5. k21 (Ctrl+V) - Paste\n6. k22 (Ctrl+S) - Save\n7. k23 (Ctrl+A) - Select All\n8. k24 (Delete)\n9. k31 (Ctrl++) - Zoom In\n10. k32 (Ctrl+-) - Zoom Out\n11. k33 (B) - Brush Tool\n12. k34 (E) - Eraser\n13. k41 (C) - Crop\n14. k42 (V) - Move Tool\n15. k43 (Ctrl+Z) - Undo\n16. k44 (Ctrl+Shift+Z) - Redo\n\nKnob 1 Gestures:\n\n1.
